# Implementation of Django CRUD at different level of abstraction.

This project contains reference examples for writing Django View with functional and OOP paradigms.

## API Endpoints

- GET, POST ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/{version_number}/{plural-model-name}/```
- GET, PUT, DELETE ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/{version_number}/{plural-model-name}/{lookup}/```

Example:
- GET, POST ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/1.0/persons/```
- GET, PUT, DELETE ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/1.0/persons/{lookup}/```

## URL Patterns
```
urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),  #  Admin urls
    path("", include("coreapp.urls")),  #  General link for other applications
    path("fbase1/", include("f1.urls")),  #  Function Base 1(Bare metal - lack of validations and security)
    path("fbase2/", include("f2.urls")),  #  Function Base 2(With forms.Forms)
    path("fbase3/", include("f3.urls")),  #  Function Base 3(With ModelForm)
    path("cbase1/", include("c1.urls")),  #  Class Base 1(With forms.Forms)
    path("cbase2/", include("c2.urls")),  #  Class Base 2(With ModelForm)
    path("cbase3/", include("c3.urls")),  #  Class Base 3(Generic Class Base View)
    path("api/1.0/", include("apis1.urls")),  #  API 1(Function Base Views)
    path("api/2.0/", include("apis2.urls")),  #  API 2(Class Base Views)
    path("api/3.0/", include("apis3.urls")),  #  API 3(Generic Class Base Views)
    path("api/4.0/", include("apis4.urls")),  #  API 4(Class Base Views with Class and Object Permissions)
]
```
